# Ruby on Rails Blogger project

@TheOdinProject  https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/ruby-on-rails

Tutorial based project

- Build blog page using rails.
- deploy to Heroku https://young-peak-53583.herokuapp.com/articles

Although this was a written tutorial led project there were certainly a few challenges mainly in the setup and deployment.  
I was very happy though on elements which were not fully led to be able to add the requirements, as well as an addition of redirecting to tag list page.
